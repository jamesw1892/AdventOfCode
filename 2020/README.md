# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). This is my second year.

I used Java this year, except for day 1 which was in Python 3.

I got both stars on every day except:

- day 16 I only got one star
- day 20 I didn't get any stars
- day 23 I only got one star
- therefore I could not unlock part 2 of day 25
