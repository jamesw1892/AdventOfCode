# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). This is my seventh year and I plan to do the puzzles in various languages depending on the puzzle and what I feel like.

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Language | Comments |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|----------|
|  1  | ✅    | ✅     | Rust     |          |
|  2  | ✅    | ✅     | Python   |          |
|  3  | ✅    | ✅     | Python   | Nice algorithm |
|  4  | ✅    | ✅     | Python   | Grid class |
|  5  | ✅    | ✅     | Rust     | This one needed some thinking about efficiency! |
|  6  | ✅    | ✅     | Rust     | Not difficult algorithmically, just how to do it in Rust with lots of functional programming as always |
|  7  | ✅    | ✅     | Python   | Used Grid class again. Part 1 was nice and easy but I could tell part 2 was going to need an efficient algorithm. Managed to come up with a nice one. |
