# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) over various years.

Years I did (more or less) as they came out:

1. 2019: Python 3 - only completed 3 days before uni work overtook me
2. 2020: Java - tried every day, but some took too long to run
3. 2021: C++ - got about half way
4. 2022: Python 3 - did most
5. 2023: Typescript & Java - only did a few
6. 2024: Rust

Years I did retrospectively:

1. 2015: I will be completing these very inconsistently and probably in various programming languages
